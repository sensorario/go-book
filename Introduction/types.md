# Types

## How are integer stored

Go has many different types to store numbers. Generally integers ans floating-points are enough to represent numbers. Humans use 10 different digits to represent numbers: from 0 to 9. The number after 9 is 10. After 99, 100. And so on. Computer do the same, but with two digits.

All of the integer types have a defined size. Signed numbers contains negative numbers. Unsigned, only positive ones. Some types are machine dependent because their zise depends on othe type of the architecture you are using.

## String

A string is a sequence of characters. String literals can be created using double or single quotes. The differences between single and double quoted strings, are that double cannot contain \n or \t. Double quoted strings allow special escape sequences. 

## Booleans

This kind of value can assume values like 0 or 1.
